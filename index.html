                <p>Hi! My name is Dani Vykydal. I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor where I study UX Design at the School of Information.</p>
                <p>One of my greatest passions is to travel. I've had the privilege of visiting many different places growing up. Some of the trips I took were with family, while others were with friends or school groups.</p> 
                <p>This website details my adventures, as well as provides some tips I've learned from them. My hope is that this site will inspire you to go on your own travels.</p>
