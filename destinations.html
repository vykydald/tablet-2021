                    <h3>United States</h3>
                    <p>I've traveled to 41 of the states in the United States. The states I have yet to go to include Alaska, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. I was able to travel to many states when my parents would take my sister and I on summer road trips. My favorite experiences on these road trips included going to Colorado to white water raft or eating lobster in Maine. I've also been to Puerto Rico.</p>
                    <p>My family has also visited the Hawaiian islands (incluing Oahu, Maui, Kaui, and the Big Island) many times during spring break as I grew up. As such, my sister and I have been to Hawaii around 8 times. Every time we visit an island, we like to explore it, try new acitivites like zip lining or scuba diving, eat local food, and interact with the locals. The Big Island remains my favorite place to travel.</p>

                    <p>The only place in Canada I've spent time in was Québec City in Canada. I traveled there in my sophomore year of high school for my french class. It was probably one of my favorite trips due to all of the fun activities I got to do with my friends. These acitivities included attending the Winter Carnival, visiting the Château Frontenac hotel, going to a sugar shack, tobogganing, dog sledding, and snow tubing.</p>

                    <p>In the summer of 2017, my family went on a cruise that traveled to Albania and several of the Greek islands. We vistited Athens, Delphi, Kefalonia, Mykonos, Santorini, and more. The places I visited in Greece were among the most beauitful sights I've ever seen.</p>

                    <p>During the summers of 2016 and 2017, I went to two ccities in Italy: Rome and Venice. While in Rome, some of the places I visited included Piazza Navona, the Colosseum, the Pantheon, and the Trevi Fountain. I even traveled to the Vatican City where I visited the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's Basilica. In Venice, I went to St. Mark's Basilica, Piazza San Marco, the Bridge of Sighs, the Ponte di Rialto, and more. My family even took a gondola ride through the Grand Canal.</p>

                    <p>In the summer of 2016, my family traveled to Paris, France and London, England. The night we landed in Paris, we walked from our hotel to the Eiffel Tower. The craziest occurrence happened when my family got caught up in a crowd of soccer fans who were stampeding the gates around the Eiffel Tower after France scored a goal in the Euro Cup. While in Paris, we also visited many the Cathédrale Notre-Dame, the Palace of Versailles, and many art museums, such as the Musée d'Orsay or the Louvre. In London, my family visited Harrods, the Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, the House of Parliament, the UK House of Commons, the London Eye, Big Ben, and several other landmarks.</p>
